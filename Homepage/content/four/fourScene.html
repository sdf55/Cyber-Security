      <p><u>How Can S3 Security Threats be Mitigated?</u></p>
      <p>Security threats can be mitigated by encrypting the data stored in the S3 Bucket. </p>
      <p><u>Why Is This Important</u></p>
      <p>Creating an unencrypted S3 object is unsafe for the user and for everyone else who uses the information that is being uploaded. This data encapsulated in the S3 object needs to be encrypted with a unique key where this key will then be encrypted by a unique master key. The master key is used to protect all of the data and the information which is stored in the S3 object.</p>
      <p><u>What Is An S3 Bucket? </u></p>
      <p>Amazon S3 stands for Simple Storage Solution, these S3 buckets are accessible from the Internet. The AWS security controls are used protect all of the resources. Some resources include: security groups, network access control lists. These resources however do not protect the data in the S3 bucket. Although, there are many ways to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data.</p>

      <p><u>What is Encryption?</u></p>
      <p>Encryption is defined as the process of converting plain text data into ciphertext so as to protect the information from being accessed by unauthorized users.  There are two main ways for data to be encrypted, first while the data is travelling over the Internet, second when it is stored on the servers. Data is encrypted  and stored in the cloud so as to safeguard sensitive information that is travelling through internet networks, the Internet and wireless mobile devices. It is essential for data to be encrypted in the cloud because enterprises and general information security controls do not have access to control data on the cloud. Also, HIPAA and PCI DSS are regulations developed by the industry and require data security to be compliant with their laws.</p>
