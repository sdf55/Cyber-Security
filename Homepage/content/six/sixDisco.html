      <h3>Discovering when an AWS role or group is alterred</h3>
      <img src="../../images/6_2.jpg" >
      <p>It is important to keep track of all ongoing activity logs of users to make sure that they are only using the applications that they have been given permission to.</p>
      <p>AWS has logging features that can determine what actions users are taking as well as the resources they are using. </p>
      <p><u>What Do Log Files Show?</u></p>
      <p>The log files show:</p>
      <ul>
            <li>Time and date of actions</li>
            <li>Source IP for an action</li>
            <li>Actions that failed due to inadequate permissions and more</li>
      </ul>
      <p><u>AWS CloudTrail</u></p>
      <p>AWS IAM, Identity and Access Management, is integrated with CloudTrail logs. Cloudtrail “logs AWS API calls and related events made by or on behalf of an AWS account.”</p>
      <p><u>AWS API Event in CloudTrail Log File</u></p>
      <p>If a user changes as AWS role the user, time, and IP address will be stored in the log file.  This is important to look at when a threat of a changed IAM role is suspected.</p>
      <p>This can be shown in the figure below:</p>
      <p>The new user below, SampleUser was added to the group newGroup, giving them access to AmazonEC2FullAccess.</p>
      <img src="../../images/6_3.jpg" >
      <p>After creating a trail names TestTrail in CloudTrail, with the S3 Bucket, the logs will be saved into the designated S3 bucket.</p>
      <img src="../../images/6_4.jpg" >
      <p>The logs can then be viewed within that S3 bucket under the Amazon Service S3.</p>
