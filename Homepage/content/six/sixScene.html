      <h3>Alters and AWS role or group</h3>
      <p><u>Overview</u></p>
      <p>If the attacker changes the permissions of a role or the group, they could give themselves access to various privileges, such as, changing roles to have full access. These could prove to be detrimental to the system. </p>
      <img src="../../images/6_1.jpg" >
      <p><u>What is a User?</u></p>
      <p>A user is an entity that is created in AWS. A user represents a person or service as they interact with AWS. A user gives people the ability to sign in to the AWS Management Console and to interact with AWS services using API or CLI. At creation, users are given permissions by adding them to a group or individual policies. </p>
      <p><u>What is a Group?</u></p>
      <p>A group is a collection of users. An IAM group is a collection of IAM users. Groups can be used to specify permissions for any collection of users. A group can be used to simplify the process of managing permissions for those users. </p>
      <p><u>Example:</u></p>
      <p>There is a group Developers, who have the permissions that developers typically need. Every user in this group automatically has permissions that are assigned to the group. All members in Developers have the ability to create, edit, and manage the code; however are unable to deploy the code. If a new user joins your organization and should have developer privileges, the proper permissions can be assigned by adding that user to the group. Similarly, if an employeeâ€™s job changes and they should no longer have access to everything developers have access to, they can simply be removed from the group.</p>
      <p><u>What is a Role?</u></p>
      <p>An IAM role, similarly to users, is an identity with permission policies. The policies determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. A role, unlike users, do not require credentials. A role is intended to be used by anyone who needs it. IAM users can temporarily assume a role to be given those specific permissions for a specific task. They can be used to delegate access to users, applications, or services that don't normally have access to your AWS resources. Roles can be assigned within the company, or to an external user. </p>
      <p><u>Example:</u></p>
      <p>You might want to grant users in your AWS account access to resources they don't usually have, or grant users in one AWS account access to resources in another account. </p>
