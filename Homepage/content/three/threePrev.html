      <h3>Preventing Global Writes</h3>
      <p>Server Access Logging with Amazon S3 provides a rich set of mechanisms for you to manage access to your buckets and objects. An Access Control List (ACL) is one of these access control mechanisms. Logs can be found in the log delivery account, The Log Delivery group.</p>
      <p><u>What Is An Access Control List?</u></p>
      <p>Access Control Lists identify which AWS account or groups are allowed to perform what kind of actions. It is necessary to grant the Log Delivery group write permission on the target bucket. Each bucket and object has an ACL attached to it.</p>
      <img src="../../images/3_4.jpg" >
      <p>What are the defaults in an Access Control List?</p>
      <p>It is important to understand what when Amazon S3 buckets or objects are created, the default ACL grants the owner full control over the resource shown.</p>
      <p>In the photo below, you can see a sample bucket ACL and the owner's full control over the resource:</p>
      <img src="../../images/3_5.jpg" >
      <p>Others can be granted access to the bucket, however it is important not to give full control and just give the control necessary.</p>
      <p>In order for the Log Delivery group to have write access, it is necessary to “grant the Log Delivery group write permission on the target bucket by adding a grant entry in the bucket's access control list (ACL).” Write access can only be granted on a bucket, not an object. Allowing write access it allows the specified user/group access to create, overwrite, and delete any object in the bucket.</p>
      <p>If permission is not granted to the group they will not have write access.</p>
